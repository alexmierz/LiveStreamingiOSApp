# LiveStreaming iOS App
> A low-latency in-app livestreaming application using Stream's edge network of servers around the world.



Developed a cutting-edge live streaming app using SwiftUI, which is revolutionizing the world of online video communication. This app stands out for its ultra-low latency streaming capabilities, ensuring real-time interaction and seamless video playback. By integrating WebRTC input, it facilitates high-quality, peer-to-peer video conferencing and live broadcasting. While currently focusing on the core streaming functionality, I am actively working on incorporating interactive features such as live reactions and a chat system to enhance user engagement and interaction. The app leverages several robust libraries including SwiftUI for the user interface, StreamVideo and StreamVideoSwiftUI for efficient video streaming, AVFoundation for audiovisual media handling, and EffectsLibrary to add visually appealing effects. This combination of technologies makes the app not only powerful in performance but also intuitive and engaging for users, setting a new standard in live streaming experiences.
